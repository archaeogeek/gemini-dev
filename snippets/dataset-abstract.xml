        <gco:CharacterString>The data shows polygonal and selected linear geological information, sourced from published 
          BGS 1:625 000 scale maps of Great Britain. 
          However, geological units are identified using the most up-to-date nomenclature that may differ from that on the 
          printed maps. The maps are generally based on published material at 1:50 000 scale and compiled using techniques of 
          selection, generalisation and exaggeration. The geology is fitted to a relevant topographic base at the time of 
          production. Full UK coverage is available. The data is available in vector format. BGS licensing terms and 
          conditions apply to external use of the data.
